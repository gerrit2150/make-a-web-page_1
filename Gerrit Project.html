        how the web works in most simple terms
      </div>
      <div class="note-desc">
      	the internet is a number of computers (<b>servers</b>) linked with each other. <b>http</b> is the technology protocoll on which computers link and communicate. <br> through my browser i send a http-request to a server. the server sends an <b>html</b> file. Html is a language my browser can interprete and visualize to me. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> does likely a better job at explaining.

      <div class="note-desc">
      	...the experts say. what they mean is if I I type <em> enusre hte enxt wrod is bodl</em>, a human understands this instruction - a computer does not.That is why languages like <b>html</b> exist. It stands for <em>hypertext markup language</em>. It uses e.g. defined elements, containing tags and content as well as attributes and their values. Using that language (without mistakes) allows you to control what one sees (<em>text</em>)and how one sees that (<em>markup</em>).

        stay cool about too many facts
      </div>
      <div class="note-desc">
      	As a beginner, I should remember that there are too many facts in programming and I should take away the bigger things. If needed I can <a href="www.google.com">google</a> the details.

        Different dimensions of structure
      </div>
      <div class="note-desc">
      	Understanding the structure used in programming is key. For this webpage exercise a <em>house</em> analogy can be used. <b>html</b> is the core structure of the house, the walls and windows. <b>css</b> is the style, the paint. <b>jobdescript</b> adds functions, e.g. the electric garage door. As in real life there are <b>rules</b>, e.g. a window cannot float in the room.

      <div class="note-title">
        "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="note-desc">
      	The "tree-like structure" means elements may have other elements inside. There is a branch and that branch can have many more branches... This text is a branch within the <em>tree-like structure‚Äù of html</em> branch, which is a branch in <em>learnings from lesson two</em> branch and so on... Reading an <b>html</b> document, the more indented an element is the more deeply is layered into the overarching branch.

        boxes, boxes, boxes everywhere
      </div>
      <div class="note-desc">
      	<b>html</b> documents are a lot of boxes. each box has four elements: margin, border, padding and content. Each can be modified to change visual appearance of box. the command <em>div </em>is a block element (a box).with <b>css</b> files one overwrite their behavior.

        stay away from repetition
      </div>
      <div class="note-desc">
      	One, it avoids errors - doing something again does not mean you do it correctly again. Two, it saves time, as you write less code, look for errors in fewer places and navigate and comprehend quickers as there is less code. <b>css</b> files are a great mean to avoid repetition when it comes to style.

      <div class="note-title">
        Cascading Style Sheets
      </div>
      <div class="note-desc">
      	Cascading Style Sheets (<b>css</b>) allow to control the style of related <b>html</b> elements. <em>class names</em> are assigned to <b>html</b> elements. Style for each <em>class name</em> is determined in the <b>css</b> file. This simplifies and avoids repetition.
